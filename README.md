# Save the Ball
Keep the ball from being touched by the other balls, made with Lua and Love2D

This is just a fun project where I try to remake my first game (built with Delphi) using Love2D. As of writing this it's not very playable, but if you want to run it you have to install Love2D then run `love .` from the terminal in the same directory as the main.lua file.
